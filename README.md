# AlgoLab4
## Algorithm Description
My function takes a binary number as a string and decimal number,
after that function creates a list of powers of our decimal number,
and calculates its powers til length of one will be greater or
equal to the length of the binary number. After that, the function reverses
the list and start looping through this list and replacing powers
if it matches some part of the binary number. In the end, the function
checks if there is something left in binary number and if yes,
returns -1, and if no returns our answer

## Setup
if you want to run tests using cmd
```commandline
py main.py
```
or
```commandline
python3 main.py
```
